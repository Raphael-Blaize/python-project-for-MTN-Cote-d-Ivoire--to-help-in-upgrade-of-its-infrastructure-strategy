  * Data Analysis used
    * Frequency in cities and Values 
    * Grouping by columns to find maxmimum and minimum of columns
    * Descriptive statistics to understand more about the measures of spread and to understand the Quartile ranges
    * Mean of the Values column and how it is spread 
    * Descriptive statistics of the Product value measured against the Cities
  * Questions to be able to solve the challenge 
     *  1. Which Citites had the highest billing
     *  2. The city with the most cells
     *  3. Which cities were the most used during business and home hours
     *  4. Most used city for the three days
     *  5. Which product is the most used in the cities
     *  6. Which city had the most value product
     *  7. Which city had the most cells on site 

## Needs of this project
